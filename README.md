# Create Your Own Cryptocurrency (Sam Token) as an ERC20 Token on Ethereum

This project aims to create a new cryptocurrency as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC20 standard is widely used for implementing tokens on the Ethereum platform.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Start a local Ethereum node:
```
npx hardhat node
```

3. Deploy the smart contracts:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Project Overview

The project involves the development of smart contracts using the Solidity programming language. These smart contracts will handle the issuance, transfer, and balance of the new token. The token will fully comply with the ERC20 standard, ensuring compatibility with existing Ethereum wallets and decentralized applications.

Additionally, a user-friendly interface will be developed to manage the new token. This interface will provide features such as minting new tokens, transferring tokens between users, and viewing token balances.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to create a new cryptocurrency that adheres to the ERC20 standard and can be seamlessly integrated with existing Ethereum-based applications. By providing an alternative payment option, the project aims to offer users increased flexibility and utility within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Moreover, this project serves as an excellent introduction to the fundamentals of creating and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

Please note that this project is for educational and demonstration purposes only and should not be used in a production environment without proper security audits and considerations.

For detailed documentation and usage instructions, please refer to the project's code and README files.

Happy coding!
